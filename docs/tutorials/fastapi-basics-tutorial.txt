FastAPI Basics Tutorial
=======================

📘 Introduction
---------------
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs using Python 3.7+ and standard type hints. It’s known for its speed, automatic documentation, and ease of use. It’s ideal for creating RESTful APIs, backend systems, and machine learning model deployment interfaces.

-----------------------
🛠️ Installation Steps
-----------------------

1. Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed:
   > python --version

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   > python -m venv venv
   > source venv/bin/activate    # On Mac/Linux
   > venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

3. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
   > pip install fastapi uvicorn

-----------------------
📚 Key Concepts to Know
-----------------------

- **FastAPI app instance:** The main object that handles requests.
- **Path Operations:** The routes or endpoints that define what happens at each URL.
- **Decorators:** Used to define HTTP methods such as @app.get(), @app.post(), etc.
- **Request & Response Models:** Define the data structure of inputs and outputs using Pydantic.
- **Automatic Docs:** Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`) are generated automatically.
- **Uvicorn:** The ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application.
- **Dependency Injection:** A built-in system for reusing logic and managing components efficiently.

-----------------------
🚀 How to Run
-----------------------

1. Create your main application file, usually named `main.py`.
2. Run your application with:
   > uvicorn main:app --reload
3. Open in your browser:
   - API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Interactive Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   - ReDoc Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

-----------------------
🎯 Summary
-----------------------
FastAPI helps you build modern, production-ready APIs quickly and efficiently.
It’s easy to start, offers automatic documentation, and is suitable for both small and large projects.
