This short tutorial summarizes key React concepts learned from the official React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial.
It helps new contributors quickly understand React fundamentals used in the Frontend part of our Grad Project.

⚙️ 1. Components

Definition

Components are reusable building blocks in React that define parts of the UI (like buttons, headers, or entire sections).

Why React Uses It

They let you split your UI into independent, manageable pieces — improving reusability, organization, and maintainability.

How It’s Written

// function Welcome() {
//   return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
// }

When to Use

Whenever you need a reusable or logical piece of UI — like cards, forms, buttons, or sections.

💠 2. JSX

Definition

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

Why React Uses It

It makes code easier to read and lets you combine UI markup and logic in one place.
React converts JSX to regular JavaScript using React.createElement().

How It’s Written

// const element = <h1>Hello React!</h1>;

When to Use

Use JSX anytime you define what your component should display.

📦 3. Props

Definition

Props (short for “properties”) are inputs passed to components to make them dynamic and reusable.

Why React Uses It

Props let parent components send data or configuration down to children, keeping components flexible and independent.

How It’s Written

// function Greeting(props) {
//   return <h2>Hello, {props.name}!</h2>;
// }
// <Greeting name="Nada" />

When to Use

When a child component needs data from its parent — for example, a username, title, or list of items.

🔁 4. State

Definition

State is data that changes over time within a component.

Why React Uses It

React re-renders the component whenever its state changes — keeping the UI always up to date with current data.

How It’s Written

// import { useState } from 'react';
// function Counter() {
//   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
//   return (
//     <div>
//       <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
//       <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click</button>
//     </div>
//   );
// }

When to Use

When you want to track data that changes (like user input, toggle status, or score in a game).

🧭 5. Folder Structure & Organization

Definition

Organizing files properly makes collaboration and scaling easier.

Why React Uses It

React doesn’t enforce structure, but following best practices keeps projects clean and maintainable.

Example Structure

// project/
// ├── src/
// │   ├── components/
// │   │   ├── Board.jsx
// │   │   └── Square.jsx
// │   ├── App.jsx
// │   ├── index.js
// │   └── styles/
// │       └── main.css

When to Use

Always — maintain a clear folder structure for large projects.

⚡ 6. Data Flow & Immutability

Definition

Data in React flows one way — from parent to child — and state updates must be done immutably (without directly changing the existing data).

Why React Uses It

This makes applications predictable, debuggable, and avoids unexpected side effects.

Example

// const nextSquares = squares.slice();
// nextSquares[i] = "X";
// setSquares(nextSquares);

When to Use

Always update arrays/objects by creating a copy first.

🧩 7. Conditional Rendering

Definition

React lets you show or hide elements based on conditions.

How It’s Written

// {winner ?
//   <p>Winner: {winner}</p> :
//   <p>Next player: X</p>
// }

When to Use

When UI elements depend on state or props (e.g., winner messages, error handling).

🚀 8. Key Takeaways

- Break UI into components
- Use JSX for combining HTML + JS logic
- Pass data with props
- Store changing data with state
- Keep data flow one-way
- Follow clean folder structure
